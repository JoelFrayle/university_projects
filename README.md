# University Projects

This repository contains a collection of my past university projects 
from my undergraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering.

## Contents

1. [Bee Colony Simulation](./varroa_honey_production)  
   - A mathematical model of a bee colony infection.

2. [Dengue Transmission Dynamics Simulation](./dengue_transmission)  
   - A mathematical model of dengue virus transmission with seasonal variations and control strategies.  
     This project simulates the spread of dengue virus in human and mosquito populations, based on the epidemiological context of Piedecuesta, Santander, Colombia. The model incorporates seasonal changes (rainy, normal, and dry seasons) and evaluates various control strategies, including insecticide use, larvicide application, mechanical control, and vaccination. The goal was to compare these methods (and their combinations) to determine the most effective approach for controlling dengue transmission in the region. The model is implemented in Python using `scipy` and `matplotlib` for numerical integration and visualization.

3. [Tumor Spheroids (In-vitro) — HaCaT vs HeLa](https://github.com/JoelFrayle/university_projects/blob/main/Metastatic%20capacity%20in%20In%20Vitro%20model_compressed.pdf)  
   - In-vitro spheroid formation assay (HaCaT/HeLa) to relate necrotic core formation with metastatic potential.  
     Laboratory project using 3D spheroid models to compare the behavior of skin (HaCaT) and cervical (HeLa) cell lines under different seeding densities. The goal was to evaluate whether necrotic core formation could be used as a proxy for metastatic capacity in an in-vitro model. The work includes the experimental protocol, microscopy-based documentation, and a short discussion of limitations (e.g., plate adhesion effects) and improvements for future runs.
