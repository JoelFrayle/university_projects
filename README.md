# University Projects

This repository contains a collection of my past university projects 
from my undergraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering.

## Contents
1. [Bee Colony Simulation](./varroa_honey_production)  
   - A Matematical Model of a Bee Colony Infection
2. [Dengue Transmission Dynamics Simulation](./dengue_transmission)

   - A Mathematical Model of Dengue Virus Transmission with Seasonal Variations and Control Strategies:
     This project simulates the spread of dengue virus in human and mosquito populations, based on the epidemiological context of Medell√≠n, Colombia. The model incorporates seasonal changes (rainy, normal, and dry       seasons) and evaluates various control strategies, including insecticide use, larvicide application, mechanical control, and vaccination. The goal was to compare these methods (and their combinations) to            determine the most effective approach for controlling dengue transmission in the region. The model is implemented in Python using scipy and matplotlib for numerical integration and visualization.

These projects were created for academic purposes. They may not reflect 
best practices in production environments and are primarily here for 
reference and learning.
